## 5. Implementation Guide

### 5.1 Getting Started
1. **Set up basic project structure** with TypeScript and Node.js
2. **Install KIRO SDK** and configure agent hooks
3. **Create simple code analysis functions** for demonstration
4. **Implement WebSocket connections** for real-time feedback
5. **Build basic UI components** for rule configuration

### 5.2 KIRO Agent Hooks Setup
```typescript
// Example KIRO Agent Hook Implementation
import { KiroAgentHook, FileChangeEvent } from '@kiro/sdk';

export class QualityGuardianHook implements KiroAgentHook {
  async onFileChange(event: FileChangeEvent): Promise<void> {
    // Analyze code quality in real-time
    const analysis = await this.analyzeCode(event.content);
    
    // Send feedback to user
    await this.sendFeedback(event.userId, analysis);
  }
  
  async onPreCommit(event: PreCommitEvent): Promise<CommitResult> {
    // Quality gate logic
    const qualityScore = await this.calculateQualityScore(event.changes);
    
    return {
      action: qualityScore > 70 ? 'ALLOW' : 'BLOCK',
      message: `Quality score: ${qualityScore}/100`
    };
  }
}
```

### 5.3 Spec-Driven Configuration Example
```markdown
# Quality Standards Spec

## Code Quality Rules

WHEN a function has more than 20 lines THEN the system SHALL warn about complexity
WHEN code has no comments THEN the system SHALL suggest adding documentation  
WHEN variable names are less than 3 characters THEN the system SHALL flag for review
```

### 5.4 Demo Execution Priority
1. **Start with Task 1-3** (KIRO Agent Hooks) - Core showcase features
2. **Move to Task 4-5** (Real-time analysis) - Visual demonstration
3. **Implement Task 6-8** (Configuration interfaces) - User interaction
4. **Add Task 9-10** (Integrations) - Ecosystem demonstration
5. **Complete Task 11-15** (Team features) - Collaboration showcase
